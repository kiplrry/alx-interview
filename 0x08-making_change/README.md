# 0x08. Making Change 💰


## Project Overview 📝

### Objective 🎯

Your goal is to find the **minimum number of coins** required to make up a given total amount, using a list of coin denominations.

### Key Concepts 🔑

- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimize solutions by breaking down problems into simpler subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Make locally optimal choices to achieve a global solution.

## Learning Objectives 🎓

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. Understand and apply dynamic programming principles.
2. Implement greedy algorithms for optimization problems.
3. Devise efficient solutions to the coin change problem.
